# PythonPoissonPrediction
Poisson Distribution: A discrete frequency distribution which gives the probability of a number of independent events occurring in a fixed time.

I have created a Poisson Prediction model in Python, used to generate xG, Attacking and Defensive Strength for home and away teams based on the previous seasons goals scored statistics. Using these values, we can predict the most probable xG, Home goals scored and Away goals scored of the upcoming match. This program is designed for the 2022/23 Premier League season.
